Task as a Web Development Intern at Bharat Intern!

# Project Overview:
I built a weather website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions. This project was an excellent opportunity to enhance my API integration skills and create a functional, user-friendly interface.
